### Landing Page Code Challenge

Using the files provided by the company, I had to create a landing page.

#### Requirements

- I needed to create a landing page in HTML, CSS, JavaScript based on the two images provided - a mobile version and a desktop version.
- The requirement was to focus on the mobile, desktop version was not important.
- As the browsers I had to focus on Chrome and Firefox.
- I needed to use older CSS technologies like: floats and position, and not to use Flexbox, Grid, CSS Frameworks, or SASS.
- I had to create five callback functions, one should make a request and display some data.
